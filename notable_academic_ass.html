    <h1>Stavros Malagaris</h1>
    <p><em>Electrical and Computer Engineer | CCNA</em></p>
    <p>My name is Stavros Malagaris and I am a graduate electrical engineer. I am a person highly interested in many
      fields of computer science and engineering. Specifically, that season I am working towards expanding my knowledge in
      computerâ€™s network and security, alongside with strengthening my programming skills. However being someone who has not
       working experience on a specific field, but passion for continuous learning and evolvement, I am trying to carve my
        own path and find where I belong. My strongest asset, to that discovery, is critical thinking followed by my will of success.</p>
